The amount of biological data available from different experimental approaches (genome and transcriptome sequencing, structure determination, functional assays) is enormous. In our group, we use computational techniques such as deep learning, molecular dynamics simulations and sequence analysis to make sense of this data. We are particularly interested in understanding how protein folds have evolved and how protein structures and functions are encoded by the 20 amino acid alphabet.
