The amount of available biological data, originating from various experimental procedures (genome and transcriptome sequencing, structure determination, functional assays), is vast. In our group, we employ computational techniques, such as deep learning, molecular dynamics simulations, and sequence analysis to make use of this data. We are particularly interested in understanding how protein folds have emerged and how protein structures and functions are encoded by the alphabet of 20 amino acid alphabet.
